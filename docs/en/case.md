# Success Cases

(for demo only)

## Intra-organizational Case: Algobet Labs

Algobet Labs is a multi-team-collaborating organization. 

`Blokaly Badge`, as the prototype, is being customized for a solution to Algobet Labs's internal multi-access-right authentication in a secure, smart and flexible manner.

As an intra-organizational implementation, the system is constituted with different types of account which play material roles in the running system.

- Admin Account
- Team Account
- User Account



## Inter-organizational Case: Unicorn Advisor

Unicorn Advisor is a HR 'Saas' operator.

`Blokaly Authenticator`, as the prototype, is being adopted to support Unicorn Advisor's inter-organizational authentication module.

Differing from the intra-organizational application, this implementation is backed by distributed ledger technology (DLT).
